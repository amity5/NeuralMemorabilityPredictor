# NeuralMemorabilityPredictor
Predicting Image Memorability from Neural Responses This project explores how neural activity in visual cortex regions predicts image memorability using fMRI (humans) and electrode (monkeys) data. We analyze response magnitudes and apply machine learning models (SVR, SVC, MLP) to model memorability from FFA, LOC, PPA, EBA, V1, V4, and IT.
